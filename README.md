## Roadmap
During the first half of 2018, the team is focusing on the following features:
 
 - __Debugging__ 
   
   A visual debugger leveraging the Debug Server Protocol defined by the VS Code team.

 - __Workbench Improvements__

   Theia's workbench shell will be improved, such that the user can drag and drop widgets from the side bar to the main area and vice-versa.

 - __Search__

   Theia already can search files by name (<kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>). In early 2018 a full text search shall be developed and added.
 
 - __More Git Support__

   In addition to the already present commit staging view, the team will add a git history and git diff view to better visualize the different states of git repositories. 

 - __Navigator Improvements__

   The file navigator shall support decorations, which are to be used by the git and the problems view extensions. It will allow to signal on a file whether there are git changes resp. diagnostics.

 - __Better Markdown Support__ 

   The Markdown support shall be improved to allow better preview that syncs scrolling. Also rendering plug-ins based on `markdown-it` shall be supported and tools like linters and dead link checkers shall be integrated.

 - __Robustness and Improved UX__
   We will further work on simplifying Theia and its UI / UX, improve the performance and keep working on bug reports that are rolling in.

 - __More__

   Any contributors might want to work on additional things. At least this happened in 2017 and is likely to increase with a growing community. :)
